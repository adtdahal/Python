# Instacart Project

## Overview
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.


## Objective
The goal of this project as an analyst is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the following questions:

● What are the busiest days of the week?  
● What are the busiest hours of the day?  
● Are there particular times of the day people spend the most money?  
● Is there a simpler price range grouping that can be used for marketing and sales?  
● Are there certain types of products more popular than others?  
● Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?  
● Are there differences in ordering habits based on the following factors: loyalty status, region, age, family status, income?
